# Friday Codebase Agent Examples

## User Prompts

```text
Use $friday-codebase-agent full_auto to implement: add pagination to the repository file list API and open a merge request.
```

```text
Use $friday-codebase-agent to analyze the billing repository for how usage limits are enforced. Do not execute code yet.
```

```text
Use $friday-codebase-agent improve on plan 9f0c...: reduce migration risk and add a rollback test.
```

```text
Use $friday-codebase-agent execute plan 9f0c... version e12a..., then create an MR if the branch is pushed.
```

## Minimal HTTP Call

```bash
curl -sS "$FRIDAY_BASE_URL/api/mcp/tools/route_repositories/" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $FRIDAY_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Friday-Skill-Step: full_auto.route" \
  -d '{"query":"add pagination to repository file list","top_k":3}'
```

Then reuse the returned `run_id`:

```bash
curl -sS "$FRIDAY_BASE_URL/api/mcp/tools/create_coding_plan/" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $FRIDAY_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Friday-Run-ID: $WORKFLOW_RUN_ID" \
  -H "X-Friday-Skill-Step: full_auto.plan" \
  -d '{"repository_id":"...","requirement":"add pagination to repository file list","analysis_id":"..."}'
```

## External Agent Configuration

Use this shape for agents that can call HTTP tools through an adapter:

```json
{
  "friday_codebase_agent": {
    "base_url_env": "FRIDAY_BASE_URL",
    "token_env": "FRIDAY_ACCESS_TOKEN",
    "tool_endpoint": "/api/mcp/tools/{tool_name}/",
    "auth": {
      "type": "bearer",
      "header": "Authorization"
    },
    "trace_headers": {
      "run_id": "X-Friday-Run-ID",
      "skill_step": "X-Friday-Skill-Step"
    }
  }
}
```

For tools that support MCP-style server configuration, wrap the HTTP endpoint with an adapter that maps a tool call named `{tool_name}` to `POST /api/mcp/tools/{tool_name}/` and injects the token and trace headers.

## Final Report Shape
